[Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) is one of [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) written in python3.

- It supports some input formats include Markdown.
- Theme is written in Mako or Jinja2.
The user can use any existing theme or can create your own theme inherits from existing one.
- The user can specify deployment procedure and run it.
- Especially for Github pages, you can build the site, commit the changes, and push the output to github with one command.

As described in the footer of this page, I use it now.

This is a sample Dockerfile. The docker image will become about 427MB.

	FROM alpine:3.12
	
	RUN apk --update --no-cache add py-pip git bash \
	gcc musl-dev python3-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libjpeg-turbo-dev \
	&& pip install nikola jinja2 ghp-import2 \
	&& mkdir /tmp/nikola \
	&& adduser -H -D docker
	
	VOLUME ["/tmp/nikola"]
	EXPOSE 80
	USER "docker"
	WORKDIR "/tmp/nikola"
	CMD ["/bin/bash"]

`nikola github_deploy` does not work with this image. I get this message when I run it.

	git: 'fast-import' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

So I use ubuntu:20.04 for a base image.
