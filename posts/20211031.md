# connect

1. Pairing
2. To open `Bluetooth Personal Area Network Device`, right click the blootooth icon in the system tray and click `Join a Personal Area Network`.
You can create a shortcut to it where you like.
3. Right click the icon of your router device and select `Connect using` then click `Access Point`

If you use an iphone as your router device, you don't have to tap 'internet sharing' when you start bluetooth tethering.

# disconnect

1. Open `Bluetooth Personal Area Network Device`
2. Right click the icon of your router device and click `disconnect`

# data usage limit

When we use wifi on windows, we have configuration for metered connection but we don't generally when blootooth pan.

I heard that it would be possible to limit data usage by editing registry.

1. run `regedit`
2. open `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\DefaultMediaCost`
3. get full control of it for administrators
4. change value of `Ethernet` to `2`
5. restart windows

This configures also ethernet to metered connection.
