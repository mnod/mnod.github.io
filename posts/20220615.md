[Secure NTP with NTS](https://fedoramagazine.org/secure-ntp-with-nts/)

Chrony supports nts since version 4.0. I tried to build nts server and client.

## server configuration

example of chrony 4.2 on ubuntu 22.04 LTS

```
server time.facebook.com iburst maxpoll 11
server time.google.com   iburst maxpoll 11
server time.apple.com    iburst maxpoll 11

ntsserverkey /etc/chrony/key.pem
ntsservercert /etc/chrony/crt.pem
```

key.pem and crt.pem are openssl private key and certificate(with intermediate ca certificate) file pair.
The certificate needs to include your fqdn of your nts server.

When I put key and crt files in a sub directory of /etc/ssl, below error occured.

```
Could not set credentials : Error while reading file.
```

In /var/log/syslog, I found audit log of apparmor which shows it denied for chronyd to open the key file.
When I put them in /etc/chrony, I successed to run it.

Before test from client, you have to open not only 123/udp for NTP but also 4460/tcp for NTS-KE.

```
$ chronyd -Q -t 8 'server mynts.example.com iburst nts'
$ sudo chronyc serverstats
```

## client configuration

example of chrony 4.0 on Debian 11

```
server mynts.example.com iburst nts
server ptbtime1.ptb.de   iburst nts
server nts.time.nl       iburst nts
server nts.ntp.se        iburst nts

ntstrustedcerts /etc/chrony/cacert.crt
```

When you use selfsigned CA to make your certificate in the nts server, you have to show your own ca certificate file to chrony.conf in ntstrustedcerts.
