- When you run certbot in non-root user, you have to specify --work-dir, --logs-dir, and --config-dir options.  These directories have to be writable with your user.
- You can only publish new certificate file via certbot. Your new certificate file will pushed under config-dir directory. Afterward, you can deploy it with your deploy tool which you like. 
- The dns-01 challenge authentication only needs DNS validation and don't need to access via 80/tcp nor web server installation on your server.
When you use dns-01 challenge, you can use your script to update your dns resource to --manual-auth-hook (for authentication) and --manual-cleanup-hook (for cleanup entry).  
CERTBOT_DOMAIN varaible is used to show domain name which you want to use. CERTBOT_VALIDATION vaibale is used to show validation code.
